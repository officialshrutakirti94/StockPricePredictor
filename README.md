Tesla Stock Price Prediction
Welcome to my first Machine Learning project! 🚀 This project focuses on predicting Tesla's historical stock rates using a Linear Regression algorithm.

📚 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to leverage historical data of Tesla's stock prices and build a model that predicts future trends based on key features.

🛠️ Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared historical stock price data for analysis.
Feature Selection: Extracted meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Linear Regression: Used to predict Tesla's stock price movement.
🧰 Tech Stack
Python: For data manipulation and model development.
Pandas: For handling and processing the data.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
📊 Workflow
Data Collection:
Gathered historical stock price data for Tesla from reliable sources.

Data Cleaning:

Removed missing or irrelevant entries.
Normalized data for model input.
Feature Engineering:

Selected key predictors (e.g., moving averages, stock volume).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:
Trained a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library.

Model Evaluation:
Measured performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R² score.

📈 Results
The model achieved a satisfactory prediction accuracy for a first project. Further tuning and exploring other algorithms may improve results.
